## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photos/11378322.jpg">

**Hello. I'm Charmgil Hong.**

I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Handong Global University, Korea. I am interested in developing and applying machine learning and data mining techniques to address large and complex data-driven problems. Before joining Handong, I had the privilege of studying and earning my PhD under the guidance of [Dr. Milos Hauskrecht](https://cs.pitt.edu/~milos).


## Research Interest

I am interested in developing and applying machine learning/data mining techniques to address large and complex data-driven problems.
